I'm an experienced software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my nine years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, which have gotten me to where I am today: a Senior Application Analyst for Fiserv Inc. Before my analyst role, I worked as a senior programmer for Accenture services.<br>

Besides my professional career in Mainframe technology, my interest in learning more about artificial intelligence, lead me to enroll for an MS degree in Data Science at Bellevue University, NE.
